1. Introduction to BWAPI
------------------------

   The Brood War Application Programming Interface (BWAPI) is a free and open
source C++ framework for creating AI modules for Starcraft: Broodwar. Using
BWAPI, programmers can retrieve information on players and individual units
in Starcraft as well as issue a wide variety of commands to units, opening
the doors for custom AIs with new micro and macro algorithms.

2. Basic AI Module
------------------

1. Extract the entire zip to a folder on your computer.
2. Copy the contents of Chaoslauncher/ to your Chaos Launcher folder.
3. Copy the contents of Starcraft/ to your Starcraft folder.
4. Copy the contents of WINDOWS/ to your C:\WINDOWS or C:\WINNT folder (which
   ever your version of Windows has).
5. Open AIModules.sln and compile the project as RELEASE.
   To do this:
   5.1. Change the dropdown box in the top center of the window from "Debug" to
        "Release".
   5.2. Click Build -> Build Solution. The Basic AI Module is now compiled
        into a dll.
6. Copy Release/BasicAIModule.dll to
   <starcraft folder>/bwapi-data/AI/BasicAIModule.dll
7. Run Chaoslauncher with BWAPI Injector checked.
8. Start Starcraft: Broodwar and create a match, either single player or
   multiplayer LAN (UDP). The melee and free-for-all game modes work best, and
   BWAPI also works on some UMS maps.
9. The Basic AI Module also comes with BWTA, the Brood War Terrain Analyzer,
   which analyzes the map and locates the choke points and possible expansion
   locations. BWTA is still a work-in-progress and does not work on every map,
   so it may crash the game.
   
3. Macro AI Module
------------------

This module is not very functional yet and is basically an experimental
branch to develop a more extensible framework for macro management (since the
BasicAIModule's build order manager is rather hard to extend and customize).
